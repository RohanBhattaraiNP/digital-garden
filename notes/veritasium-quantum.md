# Veritasium - Quantum Computing Explained

Just watched this amazing video by Derek Muller explaining quantum computing in the most intuitive way I've ever seen.

## Key Takeaways

### Superposition
Unlike classical bits that are either 0 or 1, qubits can be in both states simultaneously:

$$|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$$

Where $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$

### Quantum Gates
The Hadamard gate creates superposition:

$$H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix}$$

### Real Applications
- Drug discovery simulations
- Cryptography breaking (Shor's algorithm)
- Optimization problems
- Climate modeling

## Mind-Blowing Fact

With just 300 qubits in perfect superposition, you could represent more states than there are atoms in the universe ($2^{300} \approx 10^{90}$).

## Why It Matters

This connects directly to my [[particle-physics]] research at LDMx. Understanding quantum mechanics at this fundamental level helps me appreciate the particle detection systems we're building.
