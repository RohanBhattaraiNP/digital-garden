# 3Blue1Brown - Essence of Calculus Series

Grant Sanderson's visualization of calculus is absolutely brilliant. It made me rethink everything I thought I knew about derivatives and integrals.

## The Core Insight

A derivative isn't just "the slope" - it's the **best linear approximation** to a function at a point.

$$f(x + dx) \approx f(x) + f'(x) \cdot dx$$

## Visual Understanding

The integral as the "anti-derivative" finally makes sense when you see it as:
- Slicing areas into infinitesimal rectangles
- Each rectangle has width $dx$ and height $f(x)$
- Sum them all: $\int_a^b f(x)dx$

## Fundamental Theorem of Calculus

$$\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)dt = f(x)$$

This is beautiful because it shows that differentiation and integration are inverse operations!

## Applications in My Work

This intuition helps me understand:
- Optimization in [[neural-networks]]
- Physics equations in my research
- Signal processing in detector analysis

The way Grant animates these concepts should be mandatory viewing for all physics and ML students.
